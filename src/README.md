- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

- figuring out where to use useEffect hook
- using a button to trigger fetch operation from the API
- looping through object
- passing information from child to parent to trigger action that needs to be done in the parent component
