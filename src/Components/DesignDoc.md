Gallery
Now I'm working on the other component, which displays images that were previously clicked on.

Overview:
If you click Surprise Me!, images are stored in the gallery and displayed on the left side. 

Implementation:
1/ Keep track of a gallery array of objects and use mapping <1> to create a div with images and title to the component. 

Banned List
Overview:
This component displays a list of banned attributes. These should not be shown again on the main display. 

Implementation:
Date: compare all dates with banned dates. If requested date is banned, collect new date. 
Title: compare collected title with banned titles. If fetched title is banned, fetch another title.
